This repository demonstrates a common yet difficult-to-debug issue in React Native Android development. The application crashes with a generic error message, and identifying the root cause requires careful investigation of native modules or third-party library interactions. The solution involves verifying library compatibility, checking for native module errors, and potentially adjusting the configuration of React Native.
