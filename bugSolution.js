The solution involves carefully reviewing the integration of any third-party libraries.  Make sure all libraries are compatible with the React Native version and Android platform used. Verify proper installation and linking of native modules.  Check the Android logs carefully to locate more informative error messages within the native code. If using a library, examine its documentation for known Android compatibility issues or integration steps.  If the issue is with a specific native module, consider updating the module or checking for issues on its GitHub repository. Consider using tools like Flipper to inspect your app and network requests, which might give a better understanding of what happened.
